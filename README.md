# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
The aim of a machine learning or data science project can vary significantly depending on the specific goals and objectives of the project, as well as the domain in which it is applied. We will be using the Breast Cancer dataset taken from kaggle, which contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass and corresponding diagnosis.
